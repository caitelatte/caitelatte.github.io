            COMP3530 Week 2 (Systems Thinking):
            Lesson: Analyse a system and identify potential causes for the problem, as well as how my potential fix may affect the cause.
            Proof: unconscious biases, discussion about bias training from the ANU Disabilities Student Association
            What it changes: Research unconscious biases more before running events around inclusion. Consider what effects a project will have before committing completely to it - even though they will find another engineer, having someone point out problems will bring it to light more than if no one does.
        -->
        <p>This week we learned about feedback systems analysis, which fed right into a conversation I was involved in later in the week with a member of the ANU Disabilities Students Association. We learned that to avoid &quot;fixes that fail&quot; we should analyse the entire system or at least the overall patterns to identify potential causes for the problems, and how my potential fix may affect the cause.</p>
        <p>The member of the Association was talking about how unconscious biases can often be made worse by well-meaning training or workshops. Tests on subjects using priming - flashing a word up very briefly - and word associations indicated that their bias towards picking negative or stereotypical words according to the primed subject matter increased after attending workshops intended to lessen the effect of these biases.</p>
        <p>This is particularly relevant to what I've been thinking about in terms of computer science as a discipline. Tech culture (and indeed many popular cultures) have deeply ingrained biases against certain kinds of people, but tech has this regularly showcased and pointed out.</p>
        <p>As a result of this week I thought a lot more deeply about the problems and what can be attempted and achieved here at university and in future jobs. Maybe I should keep an eye out for projects that will actually have a positive effect on the world, rather than my previous plan of finding a company that's &quot;interesting and not too ethically conflicted&quot;.</p>
