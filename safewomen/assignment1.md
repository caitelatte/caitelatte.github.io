#Assignment 1: Portrait of a Modern Woman#

##Brief##
Before we learn the complexities of security and how to defend our companies, systems and people - we need to understand what we are protecting. In this assignment we will examine ourselves and our online identity to better understand data, privacy and why we really need to care about the security of our online applications and their users.

##Task##
This is all about you. Over the next month, every time you use a website that you need an account for, or logged into - make a note of what items of your information they store. Don't write down the value, just the name of field. For example, if the field is 'Name' and the value is 'Betty', you would write down 'Name'

Over the month you should build up a picture of your identity online.... many profiles and many pieces of information over many sites, in many countries....

Find a way to document this, it could be a mindmap, a picture, old fashioned prose.

If you feel comfortable sharing it (anonymise everything you need), that would be awesome.

##Objectives##
Understand your online presence and the volumes of data stored, understand how profiles connect, understand where your information is stored and by who
