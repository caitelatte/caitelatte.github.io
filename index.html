        <h2>what does cait do?</h2>
        <p>Cait does <a href="http://adviceformerrin.tumblr.com">adviceformerrin.tumblr.com</a> and some of the posts on <a href="http://catviceforben.tumblr.com">catviceforben.tumblr.com</a>.</p>
        <p>She has been a College Representative for the College of Engineering and Computer Science on the <a href="http://anusa.com.au">ANU Students' Association</a> and the President of the <a href="http://cs.club.anu.edu.au">ANU Computer Science Students' Association</a>.</p>
        <p>Some interesting projects Cait has worked on include:
          <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="uni.2015/letsanusa2016.html">Let's ANUSA 2016</a></strong>, a ticket of students running for the ANU Students' Association for 2016. I ran as a College Representative for the College of Engineering and Computer Science and was elected in <strong>August 2015</strong> before serving as College Representative throughout 2016.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/caitelatte/caitessegonal">caitessegonal</a></strong>, a plugin written in <strong>C++</strong> for video editing software Nuke which is meant to render a tesselating pattern of octagons and squares. It was made for a digital art course in <strong>2014 Semester One</strong>. You can check out its development over at <a href="http://caitelartv2619.tumblr.com">caitelartv2619.tumblr.com</a>.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/caitelatte/caiteshell">caiteshell</a></strong>, a very basic shell program written in <strong>C</strong> for a programming course in <strong>2014 Semester One</strong>. It doesn't produce any seg faults that she knows of, which is something to be proud of.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="uni.2015/COMP3530.html">caitecomp3530 learning portfolio</a></strong>, a collection of entries to document my opinions of systems and software engineering for assessment for <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP3530">COMP3530 - Systems Engineering for Software Engineering</a> for <strong>2015 Semester One</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="uni.2015/COMP3100.lp.html">caitechLauncher learning portfolio</a></strong>, a collection of entries to document my work each week in my Software Group Projects course in a context of systems and software engineering. Assessment for <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher">COMP3100 - Software Group Projects</a> for <strong>2015 Semester One</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/caitelatte/caitelatte.github.io">caitelatte.com</a></strong>, this GitHub site. Cait is trying for a slightly nicer approach than plaintext and html, though she'll build up the site as her skills progress. If you see anything wrong or that could use improving on this site, please submit a pull request or bug report! :)</li>
