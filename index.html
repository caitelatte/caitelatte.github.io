        <h2>what does cait do?</h2>
        <p>Cait does <a href="http://adviceformerrin.tumblr.com">adviceformerrin.tumblr.com</a> and some of the posts on <a href="http://catviceforben.tumblr.com">catviceforben.tumblr.com</a>.</p>
        <p>She's been very involved with the <a href="http://cs.club.anu.edu.au">ANU Computer Science Students' Association</a> as a General Representative on the committee since September 2013.</p>
        <p>Some interesting projects Cait has worked on include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/caitelatte/caitessegonal">caitessegonal</a></strong>, a plugin written in <strong>C++</strong> for video editing software Nuke which is meant to render a tesselating pattern of octagons and squares. It was made for a digital art course in semester one of 2014. You can check out its development over at <a href="http://caitelartv2619.tumblr.com">caitelartv2619.tumblr.com</a></li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://github.com/caitelatte/caiteshell">caiteshell</a></strong>, a very basic shell program written in <strong>C</strong> for a programming course in semester one of 2014. It doesn't produce any seg faults that she knows of, which is something to be proud of.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cait is very interested in how easy it is to work her name into the names of her projects and also delicious food.</p>
