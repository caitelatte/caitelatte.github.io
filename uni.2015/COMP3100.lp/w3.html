        <h1 id="title">COMP3100 Learning Portfolio</h1>
        <p>This page documents Caitlin Macleod's (u5351248) opinions on systems thinking and software engineering throughout Week 3.</p>
        <p>My main lesson this week came from my involvement with my new project. I learned that I should gather more information before promising </p>
        <p>The <a href="#lecture">lecture</a> this week was from Camilo Oxman on defining a problem, Innovation as a concept and an approach to creating product ideas. This week was also the week that teams were finalised, mostly at the <a href="#formation">Team Formation Day</a>. My experience of this was a little different to most as I was away on the day. By the end of the week I'd joined the group <a href="#group-project">"A Sexy, Engaging and Valuable Online Platform for InnovationACT."</a> so I'll also write about my first impressions of the group and my year ahead.</p>

        <h2 id="lecture">Week 3 Lecture - Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>This lecture seemed more focused on defining innovation in regards to start-ups and new products than exploring how to define and refine problems. Most of the students in the lecture had already done the course <a href="http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/comp2130">COMP2130 - Software Analysis and Design</a> which partially aimed to prepare us for gathering and refining requirements, so it was okay that Camillo went more for a product innovation perspective than a traditional software project's.</p>
        <p>I personally have more experience and understanding of the general concept of problem definition from completing the course <a href="http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/comp3900">COMP3900 - Human Computer Interface and Design Evaluation</a>, which covered a great range of topics related to projects that need to interact with users in any way. In that course, we learned how to collect information on how key stakeholders are going to use our products, and evaluate how our designs match up with those expectations.</p>
        <p>Camillo briefly touched on this when he talked about his paper (<a href="http://www.tesis.uchile.cl/handle/2250/100798">Material didáctico preescolar: desarrollo motriz y social a través del juego constructivo</a>) using an example of visiting preschools to understand what toddlers struggled with and what they played with. He also addressed the design iteration process - you release a product or a beta of a product, and analyse how it is used. In his own example he discovered that he had missed a key stakeholder by not analysing how the teachers interacted with toys. His design hadn't included a set of instructions for the teacher of the class, so the teacher hadn't been sure what to do with the toys.</p>

        <h2 id="formation">Team Formation Day - 28/02/2015 - and the aftermath</h2>
        <p>As I was absent from Team Formation Day, my experience was pretty abnormal. I was pretty worried about the course until I settled into a group on the 4th of March. Before the Team Formation Day, I was interested in being in the Hermes as a Service team.</p>

        <h2 id="group-project">Group Project - First Impressions</h2>
        <p>Partway through this week, Shayne helped me find a group called "A Sexy, Engaging and Valuable Online Platform for InnovationACT." I have issues with the name, but the idea looked interesting and user experience is my second preference for topic behind information security.</p>
