        <h1 id="title">Let's ANUSA 2016 Policies</h1>
        <p>In August 2015 I joined a ticket named <a href="http://letsanusa.com">Let's ANUSA</a> with a bunch of really impressive people to contest the elections for the <a href="http://anusa.com.au">ANU Students&#8217; Association</a>. I was running for the position of College Representative for the <a href="http://cecs.anu.edu.au">College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS)</a> with the below policies. After an intense campaign throughout August, it was announced that I was elected as one of the two CECS Reps on the 28th of August.</p>
        <p>My term starts on the 31st of December 2015 for a year from that date. Below I've listed my <a href="#college-policies">policies</a> and <a href="personal-profile">personal profile</a> from the campaign for prosperity, and because student election ticket websites aren't the most reliable. The <a href="http://facebook.com/letsanusa">Facebook Page</a> should be pretty long-lasting, and a lot of content is on there.</p>

I&#8217;m Caitlin Macleod and I&#8217;m a townie studying a Bachelor of Advanced Computing. I&#8217;m currently the President of the ANU Computer Science Students&#8217; Association, which offers social and educational events, a great common room space (open to all!) and advocacy to people who are studying or interested in computer science.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m running for the position of CECS Rep, a vitally important role within my college and ANUSA. CECS Reps work with students and the school to improve the experience of students within the college, and to provide important input into college processes that are usually not open or advertised to students. It&#8217;s a role that has huge potential to start important movements with ongoing support from the school, as seen by the CECS Women Mentoring program that started this year.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my year of serving as CSSA President I&#8217;ve seen some aspects of the complex system that guides the changes that affects students in my college, and have been dissatisfied with what I&#8217;ve seen. There has been little public student consultation on important changes, and rumours have abounded about a series of important changes with little to no official information being released to students.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve also seen the positive effects of the 2015 ANUSA CECS Reps with their active consultation and advocacy processes, as well as the establishment and continuation of longer term initiatives like CECS Mentoring. I also want to be in a position where I can serve as a referral service for other students interested in leadership, and believe that serving as the CECS Rep is a good way to achieve this.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stand for more student consultation and representation on important issues within the college. There are significant changes coming up for this college, with a curriculum review happening within computer science, two new buildings entering a critical stage of planning, and action on gender equality across the college coming to the surface with the Leadership Council for Gender Equality @ CECS. </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s and ensure that student consultation is the first item on the agenda for decisions that affect students and not repeat past errors in this college and others. Let&#8217;s hold regular consultation hours and start a wattle page for all students enrolled in courses in CECS and post regular updates and requests for feedback in there. Let&#8217;s ensure the equal representation of students across the college by electing our ANUSA CECS Reps from both Computer Science and Engineering.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s improve advocacy and consultation processes in CECS and represent all students in the college fairly!</span></p>

          <h2><a href="http://www.letsanusa.com/college-of-engineering-and-computer-science/">College of Engineering and Computer Science policies</a></h2>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm Caitlin the sole candidate for CECS Representative for Let's ANUSA in 2016.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout my time in the College of Engineering and Computer Science I&#8217;ve noticed three recurring issues that I&#8217;m passionate about addressing. These are: a closed-off and divided community throughout CECS, inadequate student consultation in college-driven changes that affect students, and a harmful culture around student wellbeing and diversity. Together we can work with students and the college to implement actions to address all of these.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off: CECS has a divided community, which is actively harming our students and their chances at making the right connections for their future.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are clear divides between Computer Science and Engineering, between domestic students and international students, and between students enrolled in individual CECS course and CECS degrees. This prevents students from benefiting from the knowledge and expertise of other students, especially when undertaking research or group projects. CECS is aiming to become more interdisciplinary, but we need the students on-board to achieve that. </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how I plan to address this:</span></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s facilitate events that introduce students to interesting applications of technology, as well as important but little-known skills like privacy on the internet, how to set up small automating scripts, and how to troubleshoot their ANU Secure connection.</span></li>
            <li>Let&#8217;s run more welcoming and inclusive events including undergrads and postgrads from both Engineering and Computer Science, and encourage people to interact outside of their comfort zones.</li>
            <li>Let&#8217;s bring this problem to the attention of the college, and work together on initiatives to improve our community.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout my term in the CSSA, I was also frustrated by inadequate student consultation in college processes that affect students. There are many changes coming up in the next year within CECS, with a curriculum review process for computer science degrees getting underway and two new buildings for the college going through planning stages. With so many horror stories emerging across the university over the past few years, of changes to departments and degree reviews not consulting the students that they affect, we need to reinforce the college&#8217;s understanding that students deserve to be a part of these decisions, and keep them accountable.</span></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s build a wattle page for all CECS students, where we can share what information we&#8217;ve been gathering and ask for feedback.</span></li>
            <li>Let&#8217;s move towards having elected officers of the CSSA and the ESA sit on the most important school meetings, as a backup and for a more diverse view, particularly as a safeguard for when there are no Computer Science students elected as ANUSA CECS Representatives.</li>
            <li>Let&#8217;s work with the college to run open consultation forums for issues that affect students, and make sure that they&#8217;re well advertised and accessible to all our students.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I&#8217;ve also been involved in advocacy to the college, and while there has been a lot of positive action for improving student wellbeing and diversity, there are many measures that we can implement to improve these problems.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a huge diversity of previous experience and knowledge within our college, and this currently combines with a stigma around asking for help to create an unwelcoming and unsupportive environment for people who may be struggling. This doesn&#8217;t help with the obvious diversity problems within technology, especially around gender and race. This year student wellbeing and diversity have definitely been on the agenda thanks to the college and our wonderful current CECS reps, but there&#8217;s always more to do. There have been measures put in place to tackle gender equality and move towards creating a community of ANU Tech Girls, such as the CECS mentoring program, Gender Equality@CECS Leadership Council, and the reboot of Women in Technology lunches.</span></p>
          <ol>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&#8217;s push for Mental Health First Aid training for regular faces around the college, particularly for lecturers, returning tutors and PAL mentors.</span></li>
            <li>Let&#8217;s work with the college and students to make movements towards equality more sustainable and not limited to the academic lifespan of particular people.</li>
            <li>Let&#8217;s work together to make a community where not knowing something yet isn&#8217;t looked down upon, where students can learn how to share information respectfully and helpfully.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m always happy to talk about these ideas, and interested in improving them. Constructive feedback is one of the most important things that you can contribute to anyone in this campaign. :)</span></p>
