      <h1>Coral Colour Picker (more below!)</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the fractal coral colour picker! This is a <em>challenging</em> colour picker made by <a title="caitelatte's homepage" href="http://caitelatte.com">caitelatte</a> in 2017 as part of an assignment for <a title="Art & Interaction in New Media course page" href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/">Art & Interaction in New Media</a>, a course at the Australian National University.</p>
      <p>Click anywhere on the canvas to pick a colour to start from. The middle floating <a title="A good explanation of what a fractal is." href="http://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-are-fractals/">fractal</a> will start from the selected colour each time it is changed. As the circles that make up each fractal move further from the centre, they also move closer to red, green or blue. This should make it possible to generate most colours that you can think of, given enough persistence and luck!</p>
      <h2>Settings for your Colour Picker</h2>
      <p>It might be quite hard to get to the colour that you're after. If that's the case, the controls here should help.</p>
      <p>WARNING: Resetting your reef will reset the picked colour too.</p>
